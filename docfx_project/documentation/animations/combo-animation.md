# Combo Animation

![Combo Animation Window](../../images/animator-manager-combo-animation.png)

The combo animation is a collection of [Frame Cycles](../animations-manager/index.md#frame-cycle) with the purppose of
having their execution coordinated with player inputs.

While editing the animation you can define as many chained cycles and when scripting you will have the ability to
tell the [Combo Animator](../sprite-animator/combo-animator.md) when to play the next cycle untill the animation comes to
an end or the waiting time expires and the animation is considered interrupted.

Refer to the [Combo Animator](../sprite-animator/combo-animator.md) documentation in order to have a better understanding on how you can
operate a Combo Animation through code.
