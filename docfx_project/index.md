A smooth and intuitive way to work with sprite sheets in Unity.

## Showcase

[![youtube-showcase_640](https://github.com/no-slopes/sprite-animations/assets/95456621/21942d35-ca0c-420d-b5cc-7a3c60095ba4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoCPpwkFnM)

## Why bother?

- The [Animations Manager](documentation/animations-manager/index.md) window provides qualitity of life when managing your animations and frames.
- Better perfomance than the Unity Animator since it only handles changing sprites at the SpriteRenderer and nothing else.
- Coding made easy.
- Perfect for state driven (FSM) characters.

Checkout [how it works](documentation/how-it-works.md) and give it a try!

## Key features:

- [Sprite Animator](documentation/sprite-animator/index.md)
- [Animations Manager](documentation/animations-manager/index.md)

## Beta Version

This tool should be carefully tested before integrated in a project that has commercial intentions. Although I really trust
its capacity, it is still too young to be considered stable.

## Special thanks and credits:

- [DanniBoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-souz/) for being my No Slopes associate and desining the logo and icons for the project
- [Cammin](https://github.com/Cammin), creator of [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity), for being such a friendly person and giving me directions on how to craft this docs page. BTW if you do not know [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity) yet, you should really give it a go if you work with 2D levels in unity. The quality of life this tool provide is insane!
- [Gabriel Bigardi](https://github.com/GabrielBigardi) for introducing me the concept of changing sprites of a SpriteRenderer directly instead of having Unity's animator to do so.
