# Sprite Animations by No Slopes

A smooth and intuitive way to work with spritesheets in Unity.

![Showcase video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95456621/275359291-0d4a0d30-edce-4287-8588-5d4f1aa63ad1.mp4)

## Why bother?

- The [Animations Manager](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html) window provides qualitity of life when managing your animations and frames.
- Better perfomance than the Unity Animator since it only handles changing sprites at the SpriteRenderer and nothing else.
- Coding made easy.
- Perfect for state driven (FSM) characters.
