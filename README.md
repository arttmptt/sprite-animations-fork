A smooth and intuitive way to work with sprite sheets in Unity.

## Showcase

![youtube-showcase_640](https://github.com/no-slopes/sprite-animations/assets/95456621/f99d8ecc-e337-4a99-8cd2-897e16e5d004)

## Why bother?

- The [Animations Manager](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html) window provides qualitity of life when managing your animations and frames.
- Better perfomance than the Unity Animator since it only handles changing sprites at the SpriteRenderer and nothing else.
- Coding made easy.
- Perfect for state driven (FSM) characters.

Checkout [how it works](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/how-it-works.html) and give it a try!

## Key features:

##### Sprite Animator

The [Sprite Animator](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/sprite-animator/index.html) allows to play animations
by simply changing the sprites of a SpriteRenderer.

##### Animations Manager

The [Animations Manager](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html) is an Editor window that gives
you quality of life when editing your animations.

##### Animations

- [Single Cycle Animations](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations/single-cycle-animation.html) are the most basic type of animation. Just define [Frame Cycles](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html#frame-cycle) and you are good to go.
- [Windrose Animations](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations/windrose-animation.html) are meant to help those working with top-dow games. Allows you to create one [Frame Cycle](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html#frame-cycle) for each of the cardinal
  positions and then it is easy to just change the direction based on the user's input.
- [Combo Animations](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations/combo-animation.html) are a collection of [Frame Cycles](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html#frame-cycle) that can have their execution chained. It plays one cycle, waits for user input, and then
  plays the next one.

## Beta Version

This tool should be carefully tested before integrated in a project that has commercial intentions. Although I really trust
its capacity, it is still too young to be considered stable.

## Special thanks and credits:

- [DanniBoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-souz/) for being my No Slopes associate and desining the logo and icons for the project
- [Cammin](https://github.com/Cammin), creator of [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity), for being such a friendly person and giving me directions on how to craft this docs page. BTW if you do not know [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity) yet, you should really give it a go if you work with 2D levels in unity. The quality of life this tool provide is insane!
- [Gabriel Bigardi](https://github.com/GabrielBigardi) for introducing me the concept of changing sprites of a SpriteRenderer directly instead of having Unity's animator to do so.
