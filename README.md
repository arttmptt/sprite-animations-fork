## Why bother?

- The [Animations Manager](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentationdocumentation/animations-manager/index.html) window provides qualitity of life when managing your animations and frames.
- Better perfomance than the Unity Animator since it only handles changing sprites at the SpriteRenderer and nothing else.
- Coding made easy.
- Perfect for state driven (FSM) characters.
