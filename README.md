_by No Slopes_

A smooth and intuitive way to work with spritesheets in Unity.

## Why bother?

- The [Animations Manager](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/animations-manager/index.html) window provides qualitity of life when managing your animations and frames.
- Better perfomance than the Unity Animator since it only handles changing sprites at the SpriteRenderer and nothing else.
- Coding made easy.
- Perfect for state driven (FSM) characters.

Checkout [how it works](https://no-slopes.github.io/sprite-animations/documentation/how-it-works.html) and give it a try!

My name is Gabriel, ppl know me by Gabo and you can find me as @indiegabo or @indiegabodev in most social networks.

## Special thanks and credits:

- [DanniBoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-souz/) for being my No Slopes associate and desining the logo and icons for the project
- [Fei]() for providing the spritesheets you see used in showcase videos and images
- [Cammin](https://github.com/Cammin), creator of [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity), for being such a friendly person and giving me directions on how to craft this docs page. BTW if you do not know [LDtk to Unity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkToUnity) yet, you should really give it a go if you work with 2D levels in unity. The quality of life this tool provide is insane!
- [Gabriel Bigardi](https://github.com/GabrielBigardi) for introducing me the concept of changing sprites of a SpriteRenderer directly instead of having Unity's animator to do so.
